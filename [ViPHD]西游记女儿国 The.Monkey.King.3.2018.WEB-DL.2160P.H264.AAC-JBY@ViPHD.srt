1
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,415
Master,

2
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,874
take a good look at me.

3
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,665
Since I started following you,

4
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,124
I've gotten so lean...

5
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,957
I don't look like a pig anymore!

6
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,124
What will my species think of me?

7
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,415
Good for you... I think.

8
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,415
See all that fat on you?

9
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,749
If you lost a few pounds,

10
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,582
you'd feel so refreshed.

11
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,124
Look at Wujing.

12
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,582
See how energetic he is!

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,082
Master?

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,332
Why are they all in pairs in this Mortal world?

15
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,082
Remember, Wujing.

16
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,665
All Dharmas align with life's path,
and life's path is fate.

17
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,749
Follow your fate.

18
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,207
Master,

19
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,707
if fate brings you love one day,

20
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,707
what will you do?

21
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,290
This question...

22
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,415
I might need...

23
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,749
to consult the Scriptures.

24
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,499
Cuilan,

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,290
are you doing well today?

26
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,540
Cuilan.

27
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,040
Bajie,

28
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,124
no more distractions.

29
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,415
You should learn from Wukong.

30
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,957
He never has that kind of trouble.

31
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,040
Master,

32
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,832
Big Brother is ignorant.

33
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,499
You can tell by his weapon.

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,790
You don't understand?

35
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,290
What do you mean?

36
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,915
He is lacking in love.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,790
Ask his love rod...

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,374
What were you talking about?

39
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,707
Say it again.

40
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,290
Big Brother is an expert with his rod...

41
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,665
True to his name,

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,415
this handsome Monkey King.

43
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,624
That goes without saying.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,915
You're in a good mood today, Big Brother.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,624
No pants today?

46
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,915
So cool.

47
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,624
They were stolen

48
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,790
in cool air.

49
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,874
If I catch this hateful thief,

50
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,832
I'll rip his pants off

51
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,082
so he's exposed.

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,082
Why are you staring at me?

53
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,665
I don't like your pants.

54
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,249
How funny!

55
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,040
Wukong.

56
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,624
Your pants are here.

57
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,082
Master,

58
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,665
if you liked them,

59
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,582
you should have told me.

60
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,582
Whose pants did you say

61
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,749
you would rip off?

62
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:47,957
Wukong,

63
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,290
I noticed a hole in your pants,

64
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,624
so I sewed them for you.

65
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,415
Try it on.

66
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,624
Lovely.

67
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,624
I like it. Let me try.

68
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,499
Big Brother...

69
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,124
It seems demonic here.

70
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,207
Who are you?

71
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,249
We're just passing through.

72
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,540
If you don't pick on me, I won't pick on you.

73
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,790
But if you do,

74
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,165
I'll hit you.

75
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,332
I'm Marshal Tianpeng.

76
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,499
Give me some respect.

77
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,790
Out of my way.

78
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,832
A local river god.

79
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,957
Did he answer?

80
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,874
What did he say?

81
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,790
Piss off.

82
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,249
There is only one way.

83
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,832
Bro Sha.

84
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:44,790
Get it through.

85
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,040
Okay.

86
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,665
What an enormous fish!

87
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,290
Master!

88
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,707
Master! Be careful!

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,874
Master!

90
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,457
Don't worry, Master!

91
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,249
I'm here!

92
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,874
Master!

93
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,665
Master!

94
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,749
Wukong!

95
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,374
Big Brother!

96
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,415
Big Brother!

97
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,165
I'm all right!

98
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,207
Leave me alone!

99
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,540
Master!

100
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,915
Master,

101
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,915
are you all right?

102
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,790
Totally fine.

103
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,332
We're tired from our journey,

104
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,582
with more dust and dirt on the way.

105
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,999
Please forgive me, Benefactor.

106
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,957
You...

107
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,832
are...

108
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,749
a man?

109
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,207
Well, Benefactor,

110
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,374
do I not look like...

111
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,124
a man?

112
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,124
Who are you?

113
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,249
Your Majesty,

114
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,374
what took you so long?

115
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,540
Next time, we won't be able to conceal it.

116
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,582
Let the maids out.

117
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,249
You're dismissed.

118
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,082
Yes, Madam.

119
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,457
What happened, Your Majesty?

120
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,624
Can you guess...

121
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,999
what I saw earlier today?

122
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:27,832
What did you see?

123
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,082
Today...

124
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,832
I saw a man.

125
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,040
No way.

126
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,165
How could there be such a toxic creature
in The Womanland?

127
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,040
It's fate.

128
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,665
I even talked to him.

129
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,374
What did he look like?

130
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,540
He has...

131
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,124
eyes that are quite large,

132
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,040
with double eyelids.

133
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,540
His smile...

134
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,999
it's so warm...

135
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,290
and so kind.

136
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,832
Oh, I see.

137
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,540
She is sick.

138
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,040
Her Majesty is sick.

139
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,624
Looks like it's time to open the Ancestral Book.

140
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,332
Of all the poisons, men are the most dangerous.

141
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,707
The first time you meet a man,
if your heart starts to race,

142
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,249
your limbs get weak, and you're trembling all over,

143
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,665
it means you've been cursed

144
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,790
by Man's love poison.

145
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,290
Please, continue.

146
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,832
And then...

147
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:49,874
Then what?

148
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,582
It's Over.

149
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,374
Over?

150
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,374
You mean there's no cure?

151
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,124
That's the end of the passage.

152
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,582
There's a part missing here.

153
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,040
Is this curse...

154
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,540
contagious?

155
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,374
It only attacks the central nervous system.

156
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,374
It mostly spreads from men to women.

157
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,457
Madam Preceptor,

158
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,624
Ancestor Queen once said,

159
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,249
of all things in this world,

160
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,665
it is man alone

161
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,207
that is most venomous,

162
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,249
and full of deception.

163
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,290
Once you're infected with the love poison,

164
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,749
your heart will break,

165
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,415
and you'll die from sorrow.

166
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,957
The antidote...

167
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,165
is to cut it off at the root.

168
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,249
Men must be killed.

169
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,665
Kill them?

170
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,249
Kill them.

171
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,249
Kill them.

172
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,832
You must be tired today.

173
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,332
Get some rest.

174
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,082
Guards.

175
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,499
Go.

176
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,040
Go look.

177
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,374
Yes, Madam.

178
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,457
Where's Bajie?

179
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,374
Bro Sha.

180
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,290
Where's Bajie?

181
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,249
Master.

182
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,124
Where is Second Brother?

183
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,249
What are you looking at?

184
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,790
Let's bathe together.

185
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:10,999
Sure!

186
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:11,665
That's great.

187
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,582
Master.

188
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,790
Help!

189
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,124
Master!

190
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,832
Help me!

191
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,832
Wukong, you mustn't use force.

192
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,457
Amitabha.

193
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,249
Get them.

194
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,915
Look! This is a man.

195
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,999
All women.

196
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,249
They're so scary, Mom.

197
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,207
Benefactor, where am I?

198
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,999
The Womanland of Western Liang.

199
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,207
Hey.

200
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,540
So there aren't...

201
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,124
any males here?

202
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,457
Are you deaf?

203
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,415
The Womanland.

204
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,332
I wonder...

205
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,915
what sin we committed.

206
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,124
Being a man

207
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,374
is a capital crime.

208
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,332
That's truly funny.

209
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,040
What are you looking at?

210
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,082
Her Majesty is here.

211
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,582
The deer.

212
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:20,999
It's her.

213
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,249
Hey, girl.

214
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,249
Don't you be looking...

215
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,374
at my Master that way.

216
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,665
Did you hear me?

217
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:35,749
Wukong.

218
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:37,749
Where are your manners?

219
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,540
Your Majesty.

220
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,457
Yesterday, Our Chief Priest noticed
the Motherhood River was restless.

221
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,290
She knew a poison was coming.

222
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,665
Just as expected.

223
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,165
We caught four poisonous creatures

224
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,415
and a stallion.

225
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,082
Please be sensible in your decision,

226
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,582
and pay no attention to their mistaken ideas.

227
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,540
Your Majesty,

228
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,999
my party just came here by mistake.

229
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:57,749
We are not poisonous.

230
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,915
Don't quibble!

231
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,124
The evidence is here.

232
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,332
Give us an explanation

233
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,832
after you see it.

234
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,457
Our Ancestor predicted...

235
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,540
there would be a monk

236
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,165
leading a monkey,

237
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,457
a pig,

238
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,874
and this blue-skinned bruiser here.

239
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,957
Their arrival will lead to
the end of The Womanland.

240
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,207
We have a picture to prove it.

241
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,332
Oh my gosh.

242
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:31,957
Oh my gosh.

243
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,874
It looks exactly the same.

244
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:35,749
Oh my gosh.

245
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,499
Look.

246
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,165
Just look...

247
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,915
My portrait is so lifelike.

248
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,415
Obviously, it's a bat.

249
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,332
So that's... a bat-pig?

250
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,790
That can't be a monkey.

251
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,332
It's a cockroach, obviously.

252
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,332
A cockroach-monkey.

253
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:48,915
Wukong...

254
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,832
Some new species?

255
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,665
Stop it! Now!

256
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,665
Get them for execution.

257
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,415
Yes, Madam.

258
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:54,999
Wait!

259
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,624
Hold on.

260
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,374
Her Majesty means...

261
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,124
she has to question them in person...

262
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,415
before she kills them.

263
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,290
Take them away.

264
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,207
Master,

265
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,332
if you agree,

266
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,457
I can talk with them alone.

267
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:52,707
Master,

268
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,124
on your command,

269
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,290
I'll break out

270
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,999
and smash everything.

271
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:57,999
Big Brother,

272
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,832
I'm sure Master won't agree.

273
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,415
Wukong,

274
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,082
what are you waiting for?

275
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,374
Break it now.

276
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,165
Your Majesty, you've come at this late hour...

277
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,124
You just want to see him, right?

278
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:15,749
Yeah.

279
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:18,374
No.

280
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,124
I just want to figure out
what this poison nonsense is about

281
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,749
before Madam Preceptor kills them.

282
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:25,999
Now.

283
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,624
Show me your morale.

284
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,082
Imposing.

285
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,124
Let's go!

286
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,082
Go!

287
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,790
Master...

288
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,249
just go.

289
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,624
Rise!

290
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:29,832
Master.

291
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:30,957
Are you okay?

292
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,124
Slowly.

293
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,415
Bajie.

294
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,290
Give me a hand.

295
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:56,624
Master,

296
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,832
it looks like someone...

297
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,499
set an enchanted barrier here.

298
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,915
As expected. We can't get out.

299
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,749
So, what should we do?

300
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,290
Let's go back

301
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,332
and ask that girl.

302
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,832
I know where Her Majesty is.

303
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:13,915
Wujing.

304
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,249
Are we walking back?

305
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,082
Master,

306
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,040
Her Majesty is here.

307
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,374
Who did it?

308
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,749
It's too cruel.

309
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,124
Cut it out!

310
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,665
We were attacked.

311
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,207
Who did it?

312
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,332
It must be them.

313
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,624
Everyone.

314
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,957
It's time to test our means.

315
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,207
If you've got anything good,

316
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,582
show it now.

317
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:58,249
We must find our way out.

318
00:27:59,416 --> 00:27:59,999
Wukong.

319
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,665
What good

320
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,499
do you think I've got?

321
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:04,540
Master.

322
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,332
You have nothing good.

323
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,457
We...

324
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,374
were just attacked.

325
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,082
So...

326
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,165
you did it?

327
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,290
We didn't do it.

328
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,832
I need to question you in person.

329
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,124
What are you staring at?

330
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,374
Yeah, I'm staring at you. So?

331
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,624
Your Master told you not to.

332
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:48,957
You dare hit me?

333
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,332
I dare you to stare again.

334
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,082
Well, I'm staring again. Now what?

335
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,332
Your Master told you not to.

336
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,624
Do you dare to hit me?

337
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,457
Are you acting fierce?

338
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,332
I don't like old men.

339
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,707
Don't bother.

340
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,290
I'm not interested in you.

341
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,957
We're too different, you and me.

342
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,040
What's different now?

343
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,707
If you lose, you have to tell the truth.

344
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,749
Bring it on!

345
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,040
Did I win?

346
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,582
Hold on!

347
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,082
Do it again.

348
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,249
Lost again.

349
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,249
I let Master down.

350
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,332
I let Big Brother down.

351
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,832
Look how macho you are!

352
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,082
You...

353
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,165
are...

354
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,165
far more macho.

355
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,415
I don't fear death. Why should I fear you?

356
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,915
Then drop dead right now.

357
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,957
You drop dead first.

358
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,165
Okay.

359
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,832
How uppity!

360
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,415
Ancestor Queen once said,

361
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,790
among all things in this world,

362
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,957
men are the most venomous,

363
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,082
and full of deception.

364
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,749
First, he tempts her with lies,

365
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,165
Then, he makes her have his babies.

366
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,124
After the babies are born, he'll ignore her.

367
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,499
And finally, he'll find another woman to trap.

368
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:37,957
Is that so?

369
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,582
Amitabha.

370
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:43,707
Your Majesty.

371
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,040
Actually, I...

372
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,165
I'm quite different from
the kind of man you described.

373
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:49,790
That's it.

374
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,499
Madam Preceptor told us

375
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,374
this is the very lie every man tells.

376
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,332
Now I see...

377
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,832
you're just like every other man.

378
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,624
If you don't trust me, Your Majesty,

379
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,582
why bother coming to me?

380
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,499
Because...

381
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,374
because I miss you.

382
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,874
But they say it's a disease.

383
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,540
It must be cured.

384
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,374
It must be cured.

385
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,790
Your Majesty,

386
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:31,790
have you...

387
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,040
taken your medicine?

388
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,624
It's love poison.

389
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,332
Incurable.

390
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,540
So...

391
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,832
are you poisoned?

392
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,749
Do you miss me?

393
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,749
Your Majesty,

394
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,582
I'm not that good a man.

395
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,374
Not for you.

396
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,665
I'm a monk.

397
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,082
There are many things... I can't do.

398
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,790
Plus, I have many Rules
and Commandments to observe.

399
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,374
Like what?

400
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,582
For example...

401
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,499
I'm a strict vegetarian.

402
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,749
So am I.

403
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,915
I always get up early.

404
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,332
I don't sleep in, either.

405
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:29,707
I'm not a ladies' man.

406
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,207
Neither am I.

407
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,874
Your Majesty.

408
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,415
Please. Let us go.

409
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,415
Show us the way out.

410
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,540
Let us travel to the West.

411
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,624
Do you hate me?

412
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,415
No. I don't hate you.

413
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,582
I only have one goal

414
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,249
for this life of mine...

415
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,457
to travel West, find the Scriptures,

416
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:09,415
and return to the world to ease its suffering.

417
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,624
This travel log...

418
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,415
will record my thoughts
and insights along the way.

419
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:19,290
You'll understand after you read it.

420
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,499
Keep it safe.

421
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,499
I don't have a copy.

422
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,749
You can return it when you're done.

423
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,707
You won't need to.

424
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,874
Just... give it to her.

425
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:36,832
Be generous.

426
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,040
Wukong.

427
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,415
When did you come in?

428
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:41,707
Well, I...

429
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,874
I came in as you were talking about veggies.

430
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,457
Since you accepted his gift,

431
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:48,832
tell us,

432
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:49,790
where is the way out?

433
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,999
I have no idea where it is.

434
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,499
Our tribe has never attempted
to leave The Womanland.

435
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,665
Give it back.

436
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,124
But I'll do anything I can

437
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,582
to help you find a way out.

438
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,915
The Preceptor is here.

439
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:22,999
Madam Preceptor.

440
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,374
I've questioned them.

441
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,665
Your Majesty,

442
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,665
did you fall for him?

443
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,457
No.

444
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:32,790
Why would I?

445
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,165
All right, then.

446
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,874
So let me just...

447
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,207
kill them all tomorrow.

448
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:41,332
Are you fine with that?

449
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:43,707
Yes, I am.

450
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,624
These toxic creatures should die.

451
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,540
Fine.

452
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,082
That's fine.

453
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,874
Wukong.

454
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,457
That's the thing about women.

455
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:30,040
Ancestor Queen,

456
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:34,832
where's Her Majesty?

457
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:36,957
Her Majesty thought it would be...

458
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,457
too cruel to watch.

459
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,207
Oh.

460
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,207
I've changed the arrows for execution.

461
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,499
Play dead before it's over.

462
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,415
Meet me at the foot of Mount Saintess later.

463
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,665
I have a plan.

464
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,457
This time...

465
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,374
will we be all right?

466
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:10,624
Execute them!

467
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,040
Wujing!

468
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,249
Wujing!

469
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,124
Master.

470
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,665
Die quickly.

471
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,540
How should I die?

472
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,665
He really knows the trick.

473
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,374
What a vivid death!

474
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,290
Watch and learn.

475
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:56,957
Master!

476
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,957
Master!

477
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,540
Master...

478
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,082
Awesome.

479
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,415
Come on.

480
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,665
Wait.

481
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,540
Guards, change the arrows...

482
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,040
for more powerful ones.

483
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,790
Why the change?

484
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,207
Being a man is a capital crime.

485
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,957
And being an ugly one...

486
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:57,624
double guilty!

487
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:58,790
Don't you have any taste?

488
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,374
I just have nice skin, okay?

489
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,332
Shoot!

490
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,624
I protest!

491
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,124
I'm done.

492
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,165
Throw them off the cliff!

493
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,540
Yes, Madam.

494
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,499
Keep quiet.

495
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:47,624
Master.

496
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,624
Wukong.

497
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:51,874
Bajie.

498
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:52,999
He's all right.

499
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,290
This is the Motherhood River.

500
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,165
It's where The Womanland began.

501
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,040
Motherhood River.

502
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,249
Long, long ago,

503
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,374
our Ancestor...

504
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,457
our Ancestor was betrayed.

505
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:06,290
An unfaithful Man, on their wedding day.

506
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,124
What's more,

507
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,332
that... man...

508
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:11,207
even tried to kill her.

509
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:12,832
And so...

510
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,707
when she chose to come here,

511
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:16,290
set the enchanted barrier,

512
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,082
and hide in seclusion,

513
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,207
I remember now.

514
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,165
Afterwards,

515
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,207
she recorded her lifetime

516
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,249
her experiences, back in the outside world

517
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,665
into the Ancestral Book in the Royal Library.

518
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,040
But the Book has a fragment missing.

519
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,832
That's likely the page

520
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,999
leading the way out of The Womanland.

521
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,290
That is to say...

522
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,457
your Ancestor

523
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,790
told the little crawfishes...

524
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:39,999
to guard this place.

525
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,249
Put another way,

526
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,707
this missing part

527
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,165
is probably...

528
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,415
hidden somewhere around here.

529
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,165
So what shall we do?

530
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:53,874
Wukong!

531
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,332
Find it soon!

532
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,374
It should be the face of your Ancestor

533
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,207
here on this sculpture, right?

534
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:17,832
Yes.

535
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,165
This is her sacred land.

536
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,790
No admittance.

537
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:21,957
So, you're safe here.

538
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,582
Absolutely.

539
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,290
Wukong.

540
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,999
Look.

541
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,957
The missing part, you said...

542
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,540
is it like that?

543
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,332
That's it.

544
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:01,249
Get it.

545
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:04,665
Grasp it.

546
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:05,624
I gotta hide.

547
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:06,665
I gotta go.

548
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,415
So tired.

549
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,040
It hurts.

550
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,290
Come on.

551
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,082
You won't make it.

552
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,082
Lots of people.

553
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,582
I gotta hide.

554
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,040
I gotta fly.

555
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,457
Please tell me

556
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,499
the way out.

557
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,332
Damned monkey.

558
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,249
Monkey!

559
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:45,415
Hey, big guy,

560
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,415
beat him up!

561
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,332
Big Brother, let me help.

562
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,499
Big trouble!

563
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:09,124
I'll run!

564
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,790
Your Majesty,

565
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,374
Golden Cudgel!

566
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,290
Big trouble!

567
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,082
I've gotta get outta here.

568
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:01,165
Master!

569
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:01,832
Move!

570
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,957
Have you found it?

571
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:37,249
No.

572
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:44,915
Missed.

573
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:44,790
Gotta dodge!

574
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,499
Come on!

575
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:49,624
I gotta run!

576
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,040
So... tired...

577
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:00,915
Come on out!

578
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:08,249
Shoot me...

579
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,082
if you can.

580
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:11,499
Your Majesty.

581
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:22,957
Didn't...

582
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,374
get me.

583
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,665
Missed...

584
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:26,915
again.

585
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:28,957
Oh...

586
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:29,874
I dodged it.

587
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,624
Dodged...

588
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:46,832
I'll run!

589
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,082
I'm okay.

590
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,707
Help me! I quit!

591
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:00,624
I quit!

592
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:01,790
It hurts...

593
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:03,415
Don't come over,

594
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,249
or I'll tear it apart.

595
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,207
It hurts! That's my meat.

596
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,082
Don't do it.

597
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,249
Please! No!

598
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:09,707
I quit.

599
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,082
Don't tear me apart.

600
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,249
You got my body,

601
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,790
but you won't get my...

602
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:24,707
my words!

603
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:37,124
Master!

604
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:38,249
Master!

605
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,124
Rise!

606
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:23,957
Don't do this to me.

607
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,082
I'm wrong.

608
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:25,957
Let me go.

609
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,499
Damned kid.

610
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,374
How dare you compete with me!

611
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,665
Don't play with fire!

612
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,749
Master.

613
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,707
The words.

614
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,957
It reads...

615
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,624
that the gate only opens

616
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,165
once you've learned what love is.

617
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,040
So what is love?

618
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:03,707
Well...

619
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,165
it's something...

620
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,082
I don't know much about.

621
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,832
But once...

622
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,582
I heard a rumor.

623
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,332
A romance.

624
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:17,832
Here in The Womanland.

625
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,707
A girl who fell in love...

626
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,165
with a river.

627
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,874
But they'd never met.

628
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:35,040
What's it like, outside The Womanland?

629
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:37,499
If... if it's possible,

630
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,124
I'd like to go out, just to have a look.

631
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,749
I wonder...

632
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:55,249
If I met the first person on the outside,

633
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,915
what would that look like?

634
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,082
If anyone can hear me,

635
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,499
could you answer me?

636
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,332
Who are you?

637
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,790
Why can't I see you?

638
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,124
But it seems like I can feel...

639
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:01,082
what's in your mind.

640
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,165
I believe that

641
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,624
you should be able to feel me, as well.

642
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:07,749
If...

643
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,749
If I come here for you every day,

644
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:13,790
will you always be here?

645
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:25,249
One can't find the way out of the nation,

646
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,540
and the other can't find the way in.

647
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,124
But the River stayed for her.

648
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,874
It stayed for this girl,

649
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,082
and stopped flowing.

650
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,040
Still ever since.

651
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,040
Ouch!

652
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:45,874
My belly hurts.

653
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,624
Ow!

654
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,790
Master, what's wrong?

655
00:51:58,375 --> 00:51:59,374
Help, Bro Monkey.

656
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,290
What happened to you?

657
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,374
Oh, I see.

658
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:04,624
They fell in the river

659
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,582
and drank the water from it.

660
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:06,874
What's wrong with the water?

661
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,374
The water of the Motherhood River

662
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,415
can get you pregnant.

663
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,165
Congratulations.

664
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,540
So, you're all pregnant.

665
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,624
Wukong.

666
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,249
I'm pregnant.

667
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,457
I can't believe it!

668
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,832
I'm going to be a mother.

669
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:28,290
Serves you right.

670
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,290
What do we do?

671
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:31,499
We must get out of here.

672
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:32,540
Haven't found the way out yet.

673
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,582
And you three are pregnant.

674
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,749
Why were you so careless?

675
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,165
What do we do?

676
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:40,582
Big Brother.

677
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,457
Now it's us, not you,

678
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,207
and we're pregnant.

679
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:46,374
It's okay.

680
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,540
Indeed.

681
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,207
Wukong.

682
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,249
Do something.

683
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,457
Master...

684
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:53,499
Take a look. Do I look...

685
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:54,665
Like I've had a baby?

686
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:56,665
Actually,

687
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,290
there's still a way.

688
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:02,332
Miscarriage Cave

689
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:03,165
Monkey.

690
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,290
Hurry.

691
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:04,999
Your Master and Brothers

692
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,540
will give birth in three days.

693
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,040
Time waits for no one.

694
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:08,874
Don't worry,

695
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,499
I'll be right back.

696
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:29,165
Mandarin ducks and butterflies,

697
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:35,832
With a charming garden in Spring.

698
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:39,249
Tell me, Holy Priest,

699
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:49,207
Am I beautiful?

700
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,540
Great Sage.

701
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:51,915
Am I beautiful?

702
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:53,999
The As-You-Will Immortal?

703
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,165
Are you scared?

704
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,790
A man?

705
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,540
You are a man.

706
00:53:58,625 --> 00:53:59,915
You watch your mouth.

707
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,832
They say I'm the most beautiful woman
in the country.

708
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,040
Bother!

709
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:08,374
My Master is pregnant.

710
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:09,082
I need to find water

711
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,082
from the Miscarriage Spring,

712
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:10,707
do you have any?

713
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:11,749
Okay,

714
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:12,874
just a minute.

715
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,874
Am I beautiful?

716
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,499
We have the Yin Spring and Yang Spring here.

717
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,374
So I have to blend the Yin with the Yang

718
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:24,124
and then the Yang with the Yin,
alternating seven or eight times.

719
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,999
After that, I'll add in goji, jujube,

720
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,249
scallions, garlic...

721
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:29,749
up to 49 precious herbs,

722
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,540
extracting their essence for 81 days.

723
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,665
Then you'll have the water
from Miscarriage Spring...

724
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,749
for one man.

725
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:35,707
Eighty-one days?

726
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:36,665
Yes.

727
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:37,290
It won't do.

728
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,207
Anything faster?

729
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:39,499
Sure!

730
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,249
Then I'll do it faster,
blending the Yin with the Yang,

731
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,249
then the Yang with the Yin,

732
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:44,040
and go 7 or 8 times more quickly

733
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,874
so that I can get the essence 81 days sooner.

734
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,124
Do you have any in stock?

735
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,499
Sure!

736
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,582
You mean it?

737
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,499
Look.

738
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:56,874
But... it's gone now.

739
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,040
How frustrating!

740
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,707
I know it's a painstaking process.

741
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,165
And yet, in that moment...

742
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,665
holding your child in your arms...

743
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,332
I think you'll find

744
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:15,832
that all the pains

745
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,249
will be worth it.

746
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:19,624
Your Majesty, do you mean

747
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,832
you want me to give birth

748
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,707
to this baby?

749
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,374
If you want to save the world,

750
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,457
how can you abandon this baby?

751
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:32,540
Every new life

752
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,415
is equally precious.

753
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,415
Master!

754
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,374
I'm so desperate!

755
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:42,374
Wujing.

756
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:43,874
What's wrong?

757
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:49,999
I lost my whole beard.

758
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,415
But you look good, right?

759
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:51,999
Yes.

760
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,624
But I'm extremely anxious now.

761
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,249
I'm so troubled.

762
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,165
I keep either eating or sleeping

763
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,207
just like a pig.

764
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,540
Who are you picking on?

765
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,999
Shut up!

766
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,332
Master.

767
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:08,874
Don't pressure an expectant mother.

768
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:10,290
Don't touch me.

769
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:12,999
I don't want to live anymore.

770
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,707
The truth is,

771
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,915
the Miscarriage Spring can't end a pregnancy.

772
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:26,457
The real Miscarriage Spring is in my eyes.

773
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:28,832
You need to touch me with true feelings,

774
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:31,040
and make me shed tears with true feelings.

775
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,915
That's the Spring you want.

776
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,040
Great Sage.

777
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,790
Touch me.

778
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:41,332
Touched.

779
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,082
To touch.

780
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,249
Not to hurt.

781
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,415
It's my heart.

782
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,040
You need to touch my heart, Great Sage.

783
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,165
True feelings.

784
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,999
With true feelings, bro.

785
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:56,957
Tears from beatings don't count.

786
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:58,374
What are true feelings?

787
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,165
When a man

788
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,999
is with a woman,

789
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:06,082
the true feeling is love.

790
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,915
Idiot.

791
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,540
All of a sudden,

792
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:12,374
I'm feeling happy.

793
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,582
I'm so happy.

794
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,290
Oh no.

795
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:22,540
Baby Tang.

796
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,957
Baby Tang has no heartbeats.

797
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,790
She just kicked me a while ago.

798
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,332
It's okay.

799
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,165
She is just asleep.

800
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,124
Close your eyes.

801
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,665
Feel her heartbeats.

802
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,582
Give birth to her.

803
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:05,582
I'll raise her for you.

804
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,124
If I'm to raise her,

805
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,457
no matter how hard it is,

806
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,749
it's my duty.

807
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,624
Great Sage,

808
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:25,957
why are you going to the West?

809
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,874
To get the Scriptures, and enlighten...

810
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:28,874
all sentient beings.

811
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,624
All sentient beings?

812
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:33,540
You are so great.

813
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,165
But all these

814
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,749
abortive infants were also

815
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:42,707
among the sentient beings, aren't they?

816
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:45,665
Every time they aborted

817
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,790
I would light a candle here

818
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,165
to light up the way for those infants.

819
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,165
If they don't get rid of the babies,

820
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,624
how can we get to the West?

821
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:02,790
Whatever.

822
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:04,915
I'll be the bad guy...

823
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,082
this time.

824
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,665
As long as Master makes it to the West,

825
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,124
no matter how extreme the situation is,

826
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:14,290
I can only say:

827
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:14,999
Come on!

828
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:15,665
Come on!

829
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,624
Come on!

830
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:22,540
Let go.

831
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:24,582
Stay still.

832
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:25,999
I'm almost crying.

833
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:35,082
Great Sage.

834
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:37,290
Please tell your Master

835
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,957
I truly envy him

836
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:42,165
for having you.

837
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,790
Why are you so cool?

838
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,499
Master.

839
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,915
I got the water from Miscarriage Spring.

840
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:50,915
Master.

841
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,124
The water of Miscarriage Spring.

842
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,165
Wukong.

843
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,832
I've made a big decision.

844
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:07,165
I've decided...

845
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:10,540
I'm going to have this baby.

846
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:14,582
You thought it over?

847
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,207
Go ahead, then.

848
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:23,499
Oh yeah! We'll have babies.

849
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:24,790
Let's celebrate.

850
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:26,499
Freeze!

851
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,249
Master.

852
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,999
My duty is to protect you.

853
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:42,249
You're no ordinary.

854
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:47,749
Hindered by a child,

855
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,124
how can you proceed

856
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:52,999
and how shall I protect you?

857
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,082
Unfreeze.

858
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:08,249
It's gone.

859
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:18,332
Why did you decide it for him?

860
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:19,999
That's his child.

861
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,707
You don't understand my Master better than I do.

862
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,957
What if he wants more

863
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,540
than your understanding?

864
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:28,999
I'll tell you this...

865
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,707
in my Master's heart,

866
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,082
getting those Scriptures... it's everything.

867
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,874
There's no room for anything else.

868
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,957
It's not my remark.

869
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,374
If you don't believe it,

870
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,957
just ask Buddha.

871
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:04,624
When I was young,

872
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,999
the Temple Abbot told me

873
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,124
to copy the Scriptures

874
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,790
when I was upset.

875
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,665
As I improved my handwriting,

876
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,165
my mind would be calmed.

877
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:20,874
Don't worry.

878
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:22,957
I'm all right.

879
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:08,915
How can I want it both ways?

880
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:14,624
To have you and Buddha on the same page?

881
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:20,665
Human sensuality weakens my soul.

882
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:26,665
Forget it, then. That's how it goes.

883
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:32,707
Here I am, destined for the West.

884
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:38,665
Why must I meet you now?

885
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:44,624
How can I forget you?

886
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:50,249
I'd rather forget my own name.

887
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:56,290
Forget my reign, my fortune.

888
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:02,165
Ignore your Rules and Commandments.

889
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:08,374
If you love me, hold on to me.

890
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:14,290
Take me on your journey.

891
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:20,290
Say no more merciful things.

892
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:26,332
Waste no time and stop waiting.

893
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:32,290
Even if I'll vanish in next life,

894
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:37,582
I must be with you in this life.

895
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:48,082
How can I want it both ways?

896
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:53,790
To have you and Buddha on the same page?

897
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:59,832
Human sensuality weakens my soul.

898
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:05,832
Forget it, then. That's how it goes.

899
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:11,874
Here I am, destined for the West.

900
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:17,832
Why must I meet you now?

901
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:23,790
How can I forget you?

902
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:29,290
I'd rather forget my own name.

903
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:35,332
Forget my reign, my fortune.

904
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:39,874
Ignore your Rules and Commandments.

905
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,332
Break them apart.

906
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:49,290
Take this evil monk away.

907
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:51,499
Madam Preceptor.

908
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,665
He's not like what you think.

909
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,832
Your Majesty, I just don't want you to

910
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:56,957
betray the will of our Ancestors

911
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,582
and persist in your mistakes.

912
01:05:58,666 --> 01:05:59,915
But...

913
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,207
what if Ancestor was mistaken

914
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:04,415
from the very beginning?

915
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:09,707
Then we are part of her mistake.

916
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,457
And forever we will be.

917
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:17,582
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

918
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:18,749
I can assure you that

919
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,457
I'm just putting him in jail for now.

920
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:22,374
I won't inflict a wound on him.

921
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,665
Everything I've done

922
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,124
is only for you.

923
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,249
No worries, Your Majesty.

924
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:35,582
I will be all right.

925
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:00,040
Aren't we going to the jail?

926
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:21,374
Your Excellency.

927
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,624
Cast him out.

928
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,249
Where are you taking me?

929
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,165
Move!

930
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:13,999
Push him out!

931
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,790
Your Majesty.

932
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:34,499
No!

933
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,165
In the hall...

934
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,540
that day,

935
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,332
when I submitted Ancestor's predictions...

936
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:27,457
there was a passage

937
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,749
I didn't read.

938
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,082
It said,

939
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:32,874
one day,

940
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,249
Her Majesty

941
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,915
would leave The Womanland.

942
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,082
No way.

943
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:42,874
Heaven chooses Her Majesty.

944
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,957
She bears the bloodline of The Womanland.

945
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:46,582
If she leaves,

946
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:49,207
everything here will be bleak and desolate.

947
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,415
The Womanland...

948
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,832
will no longer exist.

949
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:27,499
Big Brother.

950
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:36,999
Sun Wukong.

951
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:38,874
You're a man of miracles.

952
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,957
Please save Her Majesty.

953
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,332
Where's my Master?

954
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,874
He's now sailing

955
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,082
with Her Majesty

956
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,415
on the Sea of Suffering.

957
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,040
The Sea of Sufferings?

958
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:56,582
The Sea is boundless

959
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,207
with no way back.

960
01:10:58,416 --> 01:10:59,707
Once you set off,

961
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:01,832
you'll drift for a lifetime.

962
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,832
No one's ever made it out alive.

963
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:06,999
I'm sure

964
01:11:08,041 --> 01:11:09,582
to send you back ashore, Your Majesty.

965
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:33,374
Master!

966
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,582
Her Majesty...

967
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,165
Master!

968
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,207
Master!

969
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,582
Master!

970
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:50,374
I need a sip of water.

971
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,124
It tastes bitter.

972
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,874
It'll only make you thirstier.

973
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,665
My flesh...

974
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:05,540
can make a mortal immortal.

975
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,874
If you don't mind,

976
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:11,415
you can have a bite.

977
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:44,374
What is it like...

978
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:48,207
outside The Womanland?

979
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:51,124
There's also...

980
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,582
a sea of suffering out there.

981
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,082
But on that sea,

982
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:03,207
everyone is an island.

983
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,165
Everyone...

984
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,374
is on the drift.

985
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:10,457
But when does their drift end?

986
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,874
If I can find the Scriptures,

987
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,999
I'm bound to lead them ashore.

988
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,499
However,

989
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:25,415
beyond the suffering,

990
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:29,290
there is also joy.

991
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:34,749
It's a pity...

992
01:15:35,666 --> 01:15:37,124
I wish I were able

993
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:41,332
to show you around, here in this life.

994
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,540
It doesn't matter.

995
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,415
In the next life, then.

996
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,165
Sure.

997
01:15:57,583 --> 01:15:59,665
In the next life.

998
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,999
What a surprise!

999
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:57,874
The gate...

1000
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:01,249
it's right at the end of the Sea of Suffering.

1001
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,332
The gate is open.

1002
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:17,957
What is love, then?

1003
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:26,290
I'm going with you.

1004
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:29,582
What about The Womanland?

1005
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:36,124
I'll abandon my reign, give up my fortune.

1006
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:39,499
You can observe your Rules and Commandments.

1007
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,499
Master!

1008
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:23,749
Master!

1009
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:24,999
Rise!

1010
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,957
Master!

1011
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:37,665
Wukong.

1012
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:39,249
Master!

1013
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:42,582
Master!

1014
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:43,124
Wukong.

1015
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,207
Are you all right?

1016
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:45,082
Master.

1017
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:45,749
Let's go!

1018
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,415
Let's go.

1019
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,040
Master.

1020
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:03,332
Are you really taking her along?

1021
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,124
This child...

1022
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:21,082
bears the bloodline of The Womanland.

1023
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,499
You are Preceptor to the nation now.

1024
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:25,999
The only mission in your life

1025
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,707
is to raise her well.

1026
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,499
Don't fail the will of Heaven, now.

1027
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,832
Are you here?

1028
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:58,915
Today...

1029
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,707
is my last time.

1030
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,749
I won't be back.

1031
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:06,165
Because from today,

1032
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:09,249
I have accepted my mission.

1033
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:12,874
I'll spend my entire life

1034
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:14,999
protecting this child.

1035
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:16,790
She will be...

1036
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:19,332
Queen of The Womanland.

1037
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:24,832
While we wait to begin,

1038
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,332
as it turns out,

1039
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:29,999
it's all come to an end.

1040
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:21,999
Mercy Goddess.

1041
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,165
Dear Ancestor,

1042
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:00,207
Our people in The Womanland

1043
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:04,332
will cut off our hair,

1044
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:08,624
and weave it into an Everlight Lamp.

1045
01:25:09,416 --> 01:25:10,540
We beg of you...

1046
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:12,707
our Ancestor...

1047
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:15,957
please save Her Majesty.

1048
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:19,582
The Everlight Lamp

1049
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:22,915
must burn to the end.

1050
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,040
Only then

1051
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:30,165
will Her Majesty have the chance to wake up.

1052
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:46,290
Xuanzang,

1053
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,290
in this world,

1054
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:50,415
you can only let go

1055
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:53,374
of the things you've never owned.

1056
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:54,415
Will you choose

1057
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,957
to love one person,

1058
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:58,249
or all of humanity?

1059
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:02,499
Remember,

1060
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:05,374
the day you put your cassock on again,

1061
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,290
is the day you resume

1062
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:09,499
your journey to the West.

1063
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:11,999
Keep it in mind.

1064
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:16,082
Do you miss me?

1065
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,915
Mercy Goddess.

1066
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:03,582
Get attached!

1067
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,165
Freeze!

1068
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:17,707
Wukong.

1069
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,582
Let's just take the cassock along.

1070
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:32,832
Over time,

1071
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,540
perhaps this romance

1072
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,707
will fade away.

1073
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,082
By that time,

1074
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,124
you have to be able to wear this cassock again.

1075
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:49,999
If time were the best medicine,

1076
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:53,082
there wouldn't be so much

1077
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:57,124
incurable suffering and reluctant partings

1078
01:27:57,458 --> 01:28:00,249
in this world.

1079
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:03,915
Why are you still here?

1080
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,790
You're finally awake.

1081
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:12,665
I had a dream.

1082
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:07,665
You've waited twenty years for me.

1083
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:33,249
It's out.

1084
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:36,374
The Everlight Lamp is out.

1085
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:38,874
Her Majesty is probably awake.

1086
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:41,540
Go see Her Majesty.

1087
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,790
No, no.

1088
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:46,874
I can't.

1089
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:52,165
Everything has its destiny.

1090
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:55,249
Go greet the sea.

1091
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:08,832
No.

1092
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:09,999
No!

1093
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:23,165
Master!

1094
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:35,249
Your Majesty.

1095
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,082
Madam Preceptor.

1096
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:47,999
Your Majesty.

1097
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,165
Your Majesty, are you all right?

1098
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:50,874
My child.

1099
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,749
I'll never leave my Queen.

1100
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,832
Please... just go.

1101
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:37,999
Master!

1102
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,665
Master.

1103
01:35:58,291 --> 01:35:58,957
Master!

1104
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,790
Master!

1105
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:25,957
Go!

1106
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:26,915
Rise!

1107
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,790
Buddha,

1108
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,624
They're drowning in the Sea of Suffering.

1109
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:40,915
Please advise me...

1110
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:43,707
how to offer them salvation.

1111
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:43,790
God of the River Oblivion,

1112
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:46,040
for the past twenty years,

1113
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,665
you've been obsessed.

1114
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:53,165
And now you've committed a tremendous sin.

1115
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:56,165
Do you know you're at fault?

1116
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,165
River God...

1117
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:03,499
repent and be saved.

1118
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:00,749
I had a dream.

1119
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:05,582
I dreamed that...

1120
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:12,082
your hair was long,

1121
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:21,749
and we grew old together.

1122
01:42:23,416 --> 01:42:24,915
But you...

1123
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:31,124
you weren't happy.

1124
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,040
God of the River Oblivion,

1125
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:38,457
I understand the root of your inner pain.

1126
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:39,915
In fact,

1127
01:43:40,416 --> 01:43:42,082
the gate is always there...

1128
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:43,540
but it's our hesitation, our unwillingness

1129
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:45,582
that keeps us from going through it.

1130
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:49,082
Love is the reason

1131
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:52,999
we are born into this world,

1132
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,915
then born again, through endless reincarnations.

1133
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:58,332
But fully understanding the wonders of love...

1134
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:01,957
is eternal.

1135
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,790
From this love, I've learned that

1136
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:08,499
love for a person, or love for the world,

1137
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:10,832
it's the same.

1138
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:15,540
I will recite the Sutras for you,
thousands of times a day,

1139
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,874
until I reach the Thunder Monastery.

1140
01:44:17,875 --> 01:44:19,999
There, I will enshrine you over the pulpit,

1141
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,165
forever illuminated by Buddha,

1142
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:24,499
to help find your justice

1143
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,207
and proper retribution.

1144
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:04,499
How can I want it both ways?

1145
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:10,582
To have you and Buddha on the same page?

1146
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:16,624
Human sensuality weakens my soul.

1147
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:22,624
Forget it, then. That's how it goes.

1148
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:28,665
Here I am, destined for the West.

1149
01:45:28,666 --> 01:45:34,499
Why must I meet you now?

1150
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:40,415
How can I forget you?

1151
01:45:40,416 --> 01:45:46,040
I'd rather forget my own name.

1152
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:52,124
Forget my reign, my fortune.

1153
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:58,040
Ignore your Rules and Commandments.

1154
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:01,790
See you.

1155
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:02,832
No.

1156
01:46:03,416 --> 01:46:04,957
We won't meet again.

1157
01:46:14,375 --> 01:46:16,290
Perhaps in the next life.

1158
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:28,165
Even if it means I won't have a next life,

1159
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:33,415
I must be with you in this one.

1160
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:47,915
Disciples.

1161
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,999
What is that place ahead?

1162
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:50,957
They're mountains.

1163
01:46:51,041 --> 01:46:52,249
One after another.

1164
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:53,290
Got a name?

1165
01:46:53,375 --> 01:46:54,790
The Fiery Mountains.

1166
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:55,874
My goodness.

1167
01:46:55,958 --> 01:46:58,290
That sounds... hot.

1168
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:01,290
Let's go!

1169
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:14,165
Hey, stop. We're here.

1170
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,249
I'm sorry.

1171
01:48:16,416 --> 01:48:19,124
Where's Big Brother and Second Brother?

1172
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,457
They left first.

1173
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:22,540
Wanted me to tell you goodbye.

1174
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:26,165
No way! Why? They're so mean.

1175
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:28,999
Second Brother asked me

1176
01:48:29,458 --> 01:48:30,249
to read these words...

1177
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:31,874
just for you.

1178
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:33,249
With feeling.

1179
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:34,915
Deep feelings, and true.

1180
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:40,665
Sister,

1181
01:48:41,833 --> 01:48:43,832
forgive me for sneaking out so quietly.

1182
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:47,124
I haven't achieved what I wanted yet.

1183
01:48:47,208 --> 01:48:48,915
I need this journey to the West.

1184
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,082
Don't wait for me.

1185
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:52,957
Please remember

1186
01:48:53,041 --> 01:48:54,957
my handsome good looks.

1187
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:56,082
But, I ask you...

1188
01:48:56,166 --> 01:48:57,790
forget about the rest of me.

1189
01:48:58,291 --> 01:49:00,207
Please.

1190
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:05,207
Actually,

1191
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:09,290
I prefer your original look.

1192
01:49:10,125 --> 01:49:11,415
You mean this one?

1193
01:49:20,916 --> 01:49:23,082
She's not talking about you.

1194
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:25,540
She's talking about Second Brother.

1195
01:49:25,625 --> 01:49:27,332
Actually, your blue-skinned look

1196
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:29,082
is pretty cute, too.

1197
01:49:29,458 --> 01:49:32,040
But what'll you do with this outfit?

1198
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:33,832
If I tell you,

1199
01:49:33,916 --> 01:49:35,290
don't get scared off.

1200
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:38,124
I'm the Curtain-Lifting General.

1201
01:49:38,541 --> 01:49:40,082
The Curtain-Lifting General?

1202
01:49:40,666 --> 01:49:41,540
What's that?

1203
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,790
You don't know about this?

1204
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:45,957
In Heaven, when the Jade Emperor passes by,

1205
01:49:46,041 --> 01:49:47,999
I'll lift the curtain for him.

1206
01:49:48,083 --> 01:49:48,874
Lift the curtain.

1207
01:49:48,958 --> 01:49:50,624
You're so talented.

1208
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:53,165
Isn't that a watchman's job?

1209
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:54,665
That's an important post!

1210
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:55,790
Yeah . It sure is.

1211
01:49:55,916 --> 01:49:57,040
You are so cool.

1212
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,499
We won't meet again.
